# Single Responsibility Principle - Notes

Definition: Abstracting functionality into their own classes and functions. Separating the 'what' from the 'how'.
Benefits:
- Minimizes coupling (relationships between classes -- dependencies) 
- Simplifies maintenance
- Easier to test
- Maximizes cohesion (the relationships between the elements of a class)
